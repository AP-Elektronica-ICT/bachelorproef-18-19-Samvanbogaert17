Let's explain the UI a bit.

At the start of a level or after you exit a question menu, you will presented with the Pick Canvas.

Here you can choose what kind of question you want to answer next, or choose to pick a random question.

  </pickCanvas>
  <multipleChoice>
    <text>
If you selected the multiple choice question, you will be presented with a regular question and answers related to the question.

These questions will be much like you might have seen in other levels of the game.

  <oddOneOut>
    <text>
If you selected the odd one out question, you will be presented with a subject and certain items related to that subject and one item that isn't related to that subject.

It's your job to find which one it is, simple as that.

  </oddOneOut>
  <correctOrder>
    <text>
If you selected the correct order question, you will be presented with a subject and certain items related to that subject.

The items will be shuffled and need to be rearranged to the correct order.

  </correctOrder>
  <documentation>
    A good way to find answers to all of the questions, besides blindly guessing and hoping for the right answer, is to search in the documentation.
    
    All documentation about the Mecoms product can be found on 'idocs.mecoms.com'.
    
    Here you will find all the in's and out's of the Mecoms product and also how to do certain tasks within the Mecoms environment.
