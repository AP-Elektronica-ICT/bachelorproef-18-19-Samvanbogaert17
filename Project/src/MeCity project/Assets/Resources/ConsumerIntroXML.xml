      This is the Consumer Level. This level will all be about you and the choices you make or should make.

      In this level we are going to focus on consumer consciousness and make you a better and happier consumer!

      Before the level starts, you are going to make some character defining choices. These choises will further impact the result of other questions that will follow throughout the level.
