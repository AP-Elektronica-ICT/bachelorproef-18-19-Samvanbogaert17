In this level we will be discussing everything you need to know about the Producer.

The main goal of this level is to produce enough electricity to sell to the suppliers. This can be achieved by buying buildings that produce electricity and then selling it back to the suppliers through contracts.

But be careful! non-renewable energy producing buildings ('gray' buildings) produce pollution and this can cause happiness to decrease.

Buying renewable energy producing buildings ('green' buildings) is the obvious answer you might think, but not always.

Solely relying on green buildings can cause problems. These buildings are not very reliable since they rely on the weather, but weather can vary extremely hard from time to time.

In reality, this means the producer will need to either increase or decrease the production of 'grey' producing buildings to compensate.

The producer does not want to produce too much, because then the producer wastes electricity and doesn't gain any money by selling it.

On the other hand, the producer also does not want to produce too little, because then he will need to import it, but this usually comes at a high price.

This means you'll need to make a good mix between 'green' buildings and 'gray' buildings.

But remember! Reducing pollution as much as possible is also one of the main goals of the producer.

Let's explain your user interface.

On the left side below you can see  a slider, this is the pollution slider. This indicates how much pollution your buildings are producing.

On the right side below you can see a slider, this is the happiness slider. This indicates how happy the population of your town is.

On the left side of the slider you can see the money panel. It will display how much money you have and will open the Contracts menu. On the contracts menu, you can cancel ongoing contracts or accept contracts from new suppliers to earn more money.

On the left side of the money panel you can see the energy panel. This shows how much energy Your buildings are producing for you, minus the amount you are selling to suppliers. It is advised to keep this number as close as possible to zero, but above it.

By Clicking on the energy panel, You will open the market. On the market you can see how much your buildings are producing or buy new buildings to increase your production.

If you want to buy more buildings, you can go to the energy market by clicking on the energy button on the right side below.

Here you can choose what kind of building you want to buy. Each building has its own energy type, expected production, and pollution level.

By clicking on the 'installed button', you will see all the buildings you have installed and also how much each type of building is producing in total.

You will also notice the behaviour column, this will indicate the influence of the weather on this type of building.

if your want to sell your energy back to suppliers, you can go to the contracts menu by clicking on the money button on the right side below.

Here you can view how much energy you are selling to a supplier, what your profit is on that contract and a cancel button in case you want to cancel a contract.

By cancelling a contract, you will lose the profit but you will regain the amount of energy you sold.

During the game you will get different pop-ups. If you choose to accept the quiz pop-up, the quiz menu will appear and will present you with a question that you can answer.

If a question is answered correctly, then you will receive bonus points and also a small money reward, depending on the difficulty of the question.

If a question is answered incorrectly, you will receive a similar penalty in score.

Another form of pop-up will be the contract pop-up. These pop-ups are offers from different suppliers that want to buy energy from you and give you a profit for it.

You will also receive random weather events that will influence the production of certain buildings.

e.g. If it is cloudy, your solar panels will produce less than normal. This ofcourse will affect your total energy production, so make sure you always have a positive amount of total energy production!
